### Gm,

I am a Web3 developer, with focus on smart contract development, I am here to be part of the Future of France, I love to build things with solidity, python and foundry.
My main interested are on DeFi and NFTs.

I have been a lead smart contract developer in [CharlieDAO](https://github.com/charliedao-eth), and I contributed to [TrueFreeze smart contract](https://github.com/charliedao-eth/DeepFreeze)
